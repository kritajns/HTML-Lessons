        <!----- Phoskundo Lake Description ----->
        <h3>Shey Phoskundo Lake</h3>
        
        <p>Shey Phoksundo Lake is an alpine freshwater oligotrophic lake, which is located at an elevation of 3,611.5 meters/11,849 ft. in the Dolpa District. This lake is in the periphery of Shey Phoksundo National Park. Shey Phoksundo Lake is spread over the area of 494 hector/1.91 sq mi with the water volume is 409,000,000 m3 and discharge of 3.715m3/s. The maximum depth of Shey Phoksundo is 145 meters/476 ft. There are more than 20 stupas in the southern belt of the lake. There is a gompa in the eastern side of the lake, where annual prayers are carried out. On the lakeâ€™ southern end, the village of Ringmo sits on the 30,000-40,000 year old landslide dam that formed the lake. Past the dam, the waters of the lake plunge over a 167 meter tall waterfall, called Phoksundo Waterfall. One can observe the traditional Tibetan culture in Upper Manang and the Buddhism and Bon-Po in Lower Dolpa, including the Ringmo village.<br><br>
        
        Shey Phoksundo is considered to be a holy place by the Buddhists living in Dolpa region and around. Hence, one is not allowed to soak in the aquamarine water of the lake. Even then, the lake is worth a watch. Shey Phoksundo National Park just nearby is another reason to visit this lake. The national park is the largest national park with an area of 3555 sq km. The park has several varieties of flora and fauna. It also protects several endangered animals like the musk deer and the snow leopards.</p>
